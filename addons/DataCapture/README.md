# DataCapture Workbench addon (versioned source)

This folder is the git-tracked source of the Arma Reforger 1.8 capture addon `DataCapture`
(GUID `88BEF4187E0D2DFC`, depends only on vanilla ArmaReforger `58D0FB3206B6F859`). It replaces the untracked
`DataTest` addon (GUID `68F21EE03DB916A2`). Never load both in one Workbench session: they define the same script
classes.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `addon.gproj` | Project file (same GameProject syntax as DataTest; new ID and GUID) |
| `worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland.ent` | Arland capture world: a SubScene of vanilla `worlds/Arland/Arland.ent` |
| `worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland_Layers/default.layer` | Its layer (game mode, AI world, cars, spawn points, drive targets) |
| `deploy_manifest.txt` | The only files `tools/deploy_addon.py` may copy into the deployed addon |

Not versioned, because Workbench generates and owns them: `*.meta`, `resourceDatabase.rdb`, `UserMaps.desc`.
The Enforce scripts live in `src/enfusion/datacapture/` and are deployed to `Scripts/Game/DataCapture/` by the
manifest.

In Workbench the world is `$DataCapture:worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland.ent`. Workbench gives it a GUID in a `.meta`
file the first time it registers the world. The client launcher passes `-world {that GUID}worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland.ent`
and the MCP runbook opens `worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland.ent`. Keep this path stable: moving the world after it has
been registered changes the path that every launcher refers to.

## Deploy

```bash
python3 -I -B tools/deploy_addon.py --dry-run     # show the plan
python3 -I -B tools/deploy_addon.py               # deploy to /mnt/e/DriveDiT/addons/DataCapture
python3 -I -B tools/deploy_addon.py --emcp-handlers <BK build>/mod/Scripts/WorkbenchGame/EnfusionMCP
python3 -I -B tools/test_deploy_addon.py -v       # self-test (temp targets only)
```

The tool also writes `Scripts/Game/DataCapture/DC_BuildInfo.c` (git sha, branch, dirty flag, deploy time, manifest
and content hashes) and tracks what it deployed in `<target>/.deploy_state.json`. It deploys only into a folder inside
`/mnt/e/DriveDiT/addons/` (`--allow-root DIR` adds a scratch root under `/mnt/e/` or `/dev/shm/`, for static checks and
the self-test) and never onto C: or the WSL disk image. It refuses files outside the manifest (case variants
included), writing through a symlink or junction inside the target, and overwriting or deleting anything that
changed in the target since it was deployed (for example a layer saved by Workbench) unless `--force` is given,
which backs the old file up first.

## Editing the world

- Edit the layer here, deploy, then reload the world in Workbench. If you change the world inside Workbench, copy the
  saved file back here before the next deploy (the deploy refuses to overwrite it otherwise).
- After any hand edit, check that the world loads without `Unexpected data at offset` or `Unknown keyword` in
  `console.log` and that all entities are created. Vectors are never quoted: `m_vHoodOffset 2.2 0.95 0`.
- Never save the world from a Workbench session that loaded it truncated: saving overwrites the layer with what was
  loaded.
- `python3 -I -B tools/check_layer.py addons/DataCapture/worlds/DataCapture/DC_Arland_Layers/default.layer` checks a
  hand-edited layer statically (quoted vectors, braces, userScript, entity list) before you deploy it.
